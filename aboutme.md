---

Hi I am a M.Eng student in School of Computer Science and Engineering in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU). I work in the Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab ([HESL](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Research/HESL/Pages/Home.aspx)) under [Prof. Lam Siew Kei](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/assklam/). My research interests are FPGA based hardware acceleration for vision based deep learning and lifelong deep learning tasks.   

### my history

I obtained my BSc. from Dept. of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2016. Upon graduation I worked as a Engineer in Hardware Accelerated Systems (FPGA) in London Stock Exchange Group Technology (prev: MillenniumIT, Sri Lanka) from 2016-2018.
